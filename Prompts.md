2. Which contextual factors (domain, API size, contract complexity) influence the success of this LLM-based approach?
3. What are the best practices and lessons learned from real implementations of automated REST API tests via LLMs?
4. How do different LLM tools and approaches for generating REST API tests compare to each other?
5. How do LLM-generated tests compare to manual tests or tests generated by other specialized tools for REST APIs?

Follow these steps:

For each paper, extract (1 column for each topic below):
   - Title 
   - Authors 
   - Publication venue
   - Link to access the paper
   - Year
   - Key findings related to my research questions
