# Comparative Study Research Plan: AI-Generated Tests for REST APIs

## **1. Introduction**
- **Objective**: Analyze the effectiveness, applicability, and limitations of AI-generated tests for REST APIs across various contexts and scales of applications.
- **Scope**: Focus on comprehensive literature review (2020–2025) and analysis of documented case studies, with potential for exploratory implementation in selected APIs.
- **Research Questions** (RQs):  
  1. How does the effectiveness of AI-generated tests for REST APIs vary across different application contexts and scales?
  2. Which contextual factors (domain, API size, contract complexity) influence the success of this approach?
  3. What are the best practices and lessons learned from real implementations of automated REST API tests via AI?
  4. How do different AI tools and approaches for generating REST API tests compare to each other?
  5. How do AI-generated tests compare to manual tests or tests generated by other specialized tools for REST APIs?

## **2. Literature Review**  
### **Key Themes to Explore**  
1. **AI in Software Testing**:  
   - Evolution of LLM capabilities for test generation (from GPT-3.5 to more recent models like Claude 3.7, GPT-4o, etc.)
   - Theoretical foundations and technical approaches to AI-based test generation
   - Strengths and limitations in the context of API testing
2. **REST API Testing Fundamentals**:  
   - Key challenges in testing REST APIs (authentication, stateful operations, etc.)
   - Standard methodologies and best practices
   - Existing frameworks and their limitations
3. **AI-Powered Testing Tools**:  
   - Commercial and open-source solutions
   - LLM-specific integrations with testing frameworks
   - Novel research approaches and experimental tools
4. **Comparative Studies**:  
   - Metrics and evaluation frameworks
   - Previous comparative analyses and their methodologies
   - Gaps in existing research

### **Search Strategy**  
- **Databases**: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, arXiv, Google Scholar, ResearchGate
- **Keywords**: "AI-generated API testing," "LLM automated test generation," "REST API testing automation," "generative AI software testing"
- **Inclusion Criteria**: 
  - Peer-reviewed papers and conference proceedings (2020–2025)
  - Industry white papers and technical reports
  - Well-documented case studies with empirical results

## **3. Methodology**  
### **Phase 1: Systematic Literature Review**  
- **Initial Search**: Conduct broad search using defined keywords across selected databases
- **Screening Process**: Filter results based on relevance to research questions
- **Data Extraction**: Develop a template to systematically extract relevant information
- **Synthesis**: Perform thematic analysis to identify patterns, trends, and gaps

### **Phase 2: Contextual Classification Framework**  
- **Develop Classification Schema**: Create a framework to categorize APIs by:
  - Complexity (simple CRUD to complex business logic)
  - Architecture (monolithic vs. microservices)
  - Domain characteristics (general purpose vs. domain-specific)
  - Documentation quality and specification format
- **Validation**: Test the classification framework on sample cases

### **Phase 3: Tool and Approach Analysis**  
- **Identification**: Map the landscape of available tools and approaches
- **Selection Criteria**: Develop criteria for including tools in the analysis
- **Evaluation Framework**: Define metrics for comparing tools (without predetermining which specific tools will be analyzed)

### **Phase 4: Exploratory Case Studies**  
- **Selection Strategy**: Based on findings from Phase 2, identify representative API types
- **Analysis Approach**: Develop a systematic method for analyzing documented case studies
- **Potential Implementation**: If time permits, select 1-2 contrasting cases for hands-on exploration

## **4. Analysis Framework**  
### **Contextual Analysis**  
- **Factor Identification**: Extract contextual factors that influence effectiveness
- **Cross-Context Comparison**: Analyze how effectiveness varies across different contexts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring patterns and correlations

### **Qualitative Analysis**  
- **Best Practices Extraction**: Synthesize documented best practices
- **Challenge Mapping**: Categorize and analyze common challenges
- **Solution Strategies**: Identify successful approaches to overcome limitations

### **Quantitative Analysis (where data is available)**  
- **Metric Comparison**: Analyze reported metrics across studies
- **Efficiency Measures**: Time, resources, and cost comparisons
- **Quality Indicators**: Test coverage, bug detection rates, reliability

## **5. Potential Areas for Exploratory Implementation**  
Rather than predetermined case studies, these represent types of APIs that may be selected for deeper analysis based on literature review findings:

- **Simple vs. Complex APIs**: Exploring how complexity affects AI test generation
- **Well-Documented vs. Poorly-Documented APIs**: How documentation quality impacts test generation
- **Domain-Specific Requirements**: How specialized fields (healthcare, finance, etc.) affect test adequacy
- **Authentication and Security Context**: How security requirements affect test generation

## **6. Expected Outcomes**  
1. **Comprehensive Classification Framework** for understanding contextual factors
2. **Evaluation Matrix** for comparing AI-based testing approaches
3. **Collection of Best Practices** and recommendations for different contexts
4. **Gap Analysis** identifying areas for future research
5. **Decision Support Model** to help practitioners select appropriate approaches

## **7. Limitations and Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Literature Availability**: Rapidly evolving field with potentially limited peer-reviewed material
  - *Mitigation*: Include high-quality industry sources and technical reports
- **Selection Bias**: Risk of focusing on successful implementations
  - *Mitigation*: Actively search for documented challenges and failures
- **Tool Evolution**: Tools rapidly changing and improving
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on underlying approaches rather than specific tool versions
